# mock-users
Simple Express API for mocking user data during frontend development

Random data generated using Marak's excellent [faker.js[(https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) package.

## Usage

Customize to suit your needs by:

- rewriting the user data fields returned in **generateUsers.js**

- adjusting the weights for how frequently the _status_ field selects from the choices. Useful if you want a more representative distribution in the mocked data for your enum values.
